## Some Highlights:

### DevOps Cheatsheets
There are a lot of tools involved in DevOps. And I enjoy learning them! So when I do, I create cheatsheets with things like commands and concepts along with some sample files. I collect all of these things into a repo and they're available to whoever wants to look at them if you so choose. Feel free to check them out here: [DevOps Cheatsheets](https://github.com/ecron11/devOpsCheatSheets).
